A decentralized marketplace smart contract built on the Cosmos blockchain using CosmWasm. This contract facilitates secure and trustless peer-to-peer exchange of goods and services, leveraging the power of WebAssembly smart contracts.

Features

Listing Management:
Allows users to create listings for their goods and services.
Stores listing metadata (description, price, images, etc.) on the blockchain.
Offer System:
Enables potential buyers to make offers on listed items.
Ensures transparent negotiation processes.

Utilizes escrow mechanisms to hold funds safely until both buyer and seller fulfill their obligations.
Employs dispute resolution systems as needed.
Reputation System:
Optionally implements a reputation system to rate buyers and sellers, promoting community trust.
